        Mercury</b></i></h2>
      <img class ='m' src  ='Mercury.gif'>
     
      <p class='m'>Mercury—the smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun—is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters.

        From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as 11 times brighter.
        
        Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system— that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.</p>
      <h1 class='v'><i><b>Venus</b></i></h1>
      <img src ='Venus.gif'id='v'>
      <p class='v'>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the brightest planet in the solar system. It is sometimes referred to as the sister planet to Earth, because of the similar mass and size. The planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. In this article, we will be discussing the characteristics and a few astonishing facts of Venus.</p>
      <h1 class='e'><b><i>Earth</i></b></h1>
      <img id=e src  ='Earth.gif'>
      <p class='e'>The third planet from the sun, the one, and only the Earth, is the place in the known world.<br> Earth is the fifth-largest planet in our galaxy. Earth, our home star, is a world unlike any other. Earth tracks the sun once every 365 days. Since our civil years have only 365 days, we add an extra leap day every four years. A day on earth is 24 hours and the earth makes a complete orbit around the sun. Earth has one moon. Earth is the planet we live on. Earth is the third planet from the sun, after Mercury and Venus and before mars. Earth Planet is a complex structure.
       <br>The earth is our planet's home. We get oxygen from the earth. <br>The earth is round. <br>It is our planetary system's third planet. Earth is the only planet with life. The earth has seven continents that are very important for the earth. 
       Earth’s natural satellite is the Moon. There are many people living on earth.<br> The earth provides air to breathe, food to eat, and water to drink. <br>We celebrate Earth Day on 22 April. Earth is our home; we need to look into it.<br> Earth has various platforms.<br> We should not waste natural resources like coal, petroleum, water, and minerals found on earth.

      <h1 class='mars'>Mars </h1>
      <img src='Mars.gif' id='mars'>
      <p class='mars'>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the next planet beyond Earth. It is, on average, more than 142 million miles from the Sun. Mars turns on its axis more slowly than Earth does. So, a day on Mars is 24.6 hours. Since this planet is farther from the Sun than Earth, one revolution of Mars around the Sun is a longer trip. So, a year on Mars is 687 Earth days. Mars is about half the size of Earth. Mars is known as the Red Planet because the iron oxide chemicals in its soil looks like rust.
        <br>Mars is named for the ancient Roman god of war. The Greeks called the planet Ares (pronounced Air-EEZ). The Romans and Greeks associated the planet with war because its color resembles the color of blood.<br>Mars has two small moons. Their names are Phobos (FOE-bohs) and Deimos (DEE-mohs). They are named for the sons of Ares, the Greek god of war. Phobos means “fear,” and Deimos means “panic.”<br>Mars is very cold. The average temperature on Mars is minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit — way below freezing!<br>Its surface is rocky, with canyons, volcanoes, dry lake beds and craters all over it. Red dust covers most of its surface. Mars has clouds and wind just like Earth. Sometimes the wind blows the red dust into a dust storm. Tiny dust storms can look like tornados, and large ones can be seen from Earth. Mars’ large storms sometimes cover the entire planet.<br>Mars has about one-third the gravity of Earth. A rock dropped on Mars would fall more slowly than a rock falls on Earth. A person who weighs 100 pounds on Earth would only weigh about 38 pounds on Mars because of the reduced gravity.<br>The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth’s. The Red Planet’s atmosphere contains more than 95% carbon dioxide and much less than 1% oxygen. People would not be able to breathe the air on Mars.<br>NASA has used robotic spacecraft to learn more about Mars. In 1965, Mariner 4 flew past Mars and became the first NASA spacecraft to take close-up images of another planet. In 1976, Viking 1 and Viking 2 were the first NASA spacecraft to land on Mars. Both spacecraft took images and collected science data on the Martian surface.

      <h1 class='j'>Jupiter</h1>
      <img src='https://media.tenor.com/wfnPSysDSHcAAAAd/planet-jupiter-moving-planet-jupiter.gif'id='j'>
      <p class='j'>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.</p>
      <h1 class='s'>Saturn</h1>
      <img id='s' src='https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o7buctjKD8g5r4544/giphy.gif'>
      <p class='s'>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with a dazzling system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets.<br>It is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.<br>
        The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter.</p>
      <h1 class='u'>Uranus</h1>
      <img id='u' src='Uranus.gif'>
      <p class='u'>Uranus, seventh planet in distance from the Sun and the least massive of the solar system's four giant, or Jovian, planets, which also include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. At its brightest, Uranus is just visible to the unaided eye as a blue-green point of light. It is designated by the symbol ♅.</p>
      <h1 class='n'>Neptune</h1>
      <img id='n' src='Neptune.gif'>
      <p class='n'>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not visible to the naked eye. In 2011, Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery.</p>

<h1>Galaxy</h1>
<div class="line"></div>

<p>A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.<br> We live on a planet called Earth that is part of our solar system.</p>
<h2>Milky Way Galaxy</h2>
<img src="Milky Way Galxy.gif">
<p>The first reliable measurement of the size of the Galaxy was made in 1917 by American astronomer Harlow Shapley.
     He arrived at his size determination by establishing the spatial distribution of globular clusters. Shapley found that, instead of a relatively small system with the Sun near its centre, as had previously been thought, the Galaxy is immense, with the Sun nearer the edge than the centre. Assuming that the globular clusters outlined the Galaxy, he determined that it has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years and that the Sun lies about 30,000 light-years from the centre. (A light-year is the distance traveled by light in one year and is roughly 9,460,000,000,000 km [5,880,000,000,000 miles].) His values have held up remarkably well over the years. Depending in part on the particular component being discussed, the stellar disk of the Milky Way system is just about as large as Shapley’s model predicted, with neutral hydrogen somewhat more widely dispersed and dark (i.e., unobservable) matter perhaps filling an even larger volume than expected. The most-distant stars and gas clouds of the system that have had their distance reliably determined lie roughly 100,000 light-years from the galactic centre, while the distance
     of the Sun from the centre has been found to be approximately 25,000 light-years.</p>

    <h2>Andromeda Galaxy</h2>
    <img src="Andromeda Galaxy gif.gif">
    <p>Although several dozen minor galaxies lie closer to our Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy is the closest large <br> spiral galaxy to ours. Excluding the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, visible from Earth’s <br> Southern Hemisphere, the Andromeda galaxy is the brightest external galaxy visible in our night sky. And, at 2.5 million light-years, <br>it’s the most distant thing we humans can see with the unaided <br>Note: The large spiral Triangulum galaxy is slightly more distant at 2.7 million light-years.<br> Like the Andromeda galaxy, it’s a member of our Local Group of galaxies. And it’s sometimes said to be visible to the eye also. But it’s turned face-on to us, and so has a low surface brightness.<br>  Unlike the Andromeda galaxy, <br> it’s very hard to see.<br> Astronomers sometimes call the Andromeda galaxy by the name Messier 31, or M31.<br> It was the 31st on a famous list of fuzzy sky objects compiled by the French astronomer Charles Messier (1730-1817).<br> His catalog listed “objects to avoid” when comet-hunting. <br>Nowadays, amateur astronomers seek out these objects with their telescopes and binoculars.<br> They’re some of most beautiful deep-sky objects known.</p>
